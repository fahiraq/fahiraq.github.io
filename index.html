            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p>Do you know why i introduced myself as "Hero" on the first page?</p>
            <p>Hero is a name that i made when i was kid.
            At that time, i hate the fact that i was born as a girl.
            So i did a little changes to my name, from "fahira" to "fahero".
            And the nick name would be "Hero". Sounds like a boy's name, right?üòù
            But don't worry, mate. 
            Now i've accepted the fact that I am a woman, and I am grateful for it.</p>
